fad3 ("Fade")
======================

Famo.us/Angular + d3

Proof of concept:  Break an arbitrary SVG element out into separate Famo.us Surfaces

This was created at the Famo.us Hackathon at the HTML5 Developers' Conference in May 2014.  This code is hackathon-quality and not intended for any production purposes, though it does demonstrate some exciting possibilities for Famo.us + vector graphics.

Applications:  integrate with SVG-based tools like d3, or work as the basis of a WYSIWYG vector graphics + Famo.us animations system (like the visual authoring style of Flash)

### To run:

`npm install`

`gulp watch`
