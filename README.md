fad3 ("Fade")
======================

Famo.us/Angular + d3

Proof of concept:  Break an arbitrary SVG element out into separate Famo.us Surfaces

Applications:  integrate with SVG-based tools like d3, or work as the basis of a WYSIWYG vector-graphics-to-Famo.us-animations system (like the visual authoring style of Flash)

### To run:

`npm install`

`gulp watch`
